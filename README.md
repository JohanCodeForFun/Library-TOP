# Library Project

This project is a simple library management system implemented using TypeScript and modern JavaScript features such as classes, getters, setters, and private properties. The project demonstrates how to encapsulate functionality within classes and minimize global code.

## Features

- Add books to the library with details such as title, author, number of pages, and read status.
- Encapsulate book and library management logic within classes.
- Use getters and setters for accessing and modifying book properties.
- Handle form interactions and submissions using a dedicated class.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS
